## The Concept
A `stack` is an abstract data type(ADT) that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items.   
There are two principle operations involved with `stack`:
- the addition of elements, also known as `push` 
- the removal of elements, also known as `pop`.  

Each operation can only be performed at the **end** of the sequence.  
Thus, the operations are performed in a **Last In First Out (LIFO)** manner.  
The following is to illustrate the addition and insertion operation on stack.

**Why do stacks exist?**  
Stacks are extremely useful when the **order of actions** is important.
